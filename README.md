### Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Paul Davis
- ðŸŽ® I'm a Software Engineer actively seeking out my next opportunity!
- ðŸ“– I'm a junior at the University of Massachusetts Amherst studying Computer Science and Math.
- ðŸ“‹ I'm also Co-President of a tech consulting club at UMass called BUILD UMass!
- ðŸ“¬ Contact me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-c-davis/) or by the email on my profile!

I'm open to roles across the software engineering spectrum, but I'm particularly interested in full stack web development, games development, or tools development of any kind. I love making software that real people will use and benefit from, whether that's a game or a really useful tool.
