### Hi ðŸ‘‹ my name is Paul Davis
- ðŸŽ® I'm a Software Engineer actively seeking out my next opportunity!
- ðŸ“– I'm a recent graduate of the University of Massachusetts Amherst with my B.S. in Computer Science and Mathematics .
- ðŸ“‹ I was Co-President of a tech consulting club at UMass called BUILD UMass and managed to get 3 internships under my belt over my 3.5 years at school!
- ðŸ“¬ Contact me at my [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/paul-c-davis/), at paulcdavis135@gmail.com, or at 978-846-3698!

I'm open to roles across the software engineering spectrum, but I'm particularly interested in full stack web development, games development, or tools development of any kind. I love making software that real people will use and benefit from, whether that's a game or a really useful tool.
